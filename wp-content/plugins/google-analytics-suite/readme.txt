== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**I\'ve configured it correctly, but GA isn\'t tracking?**

It can take up to 24hours before data starts showing into your dashboard. It\'s a bad habit to check your stats each hour also, so if you are sure you\'ve configured it right check again tommorow for stats.

**The plugin can\'t find my adsense ID**

It only checkes if the adsense ID is present in the latest posts text (not widgets or sidebar). Otherwise, follow this <a href=\"http://arevico.com/how-to-get-your-adsense-id/\">simple tutorial</a>

**How can I get my analytics UA-id?**

The steps are described <a href=\"http://arevico.com/how-to-get-the-google-analytics-id/\">here</a>!

**I have a great new feature, where can I suggest it?**
